            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Main feature of this Voice assistant is having a design mode which includes the addition of newer things that the user want to add to program. That's why it is unfinished. It just like a training the code for our purposes.</p>

                <li>Main frame work of the code is down below.</li>
                <img src="images/voice/mainframe.JPG" alt="error">
                <li>Inorder to access it we need to provide the password as set initially. This codecan allow the user to have two chances to get login else the program stops execution.</li>

                <li>This program works with the use of keyword BEAST. With basic feature of making plans and set remainders, and helps to find all the tasks done by it.</li>
                <img src="images/voice/operations.JPG" alt="">
                <li>Using the concept of files all the new operations are stored and every time this file gets loaded and all the operations are added to main program .</li>
                <img src="images/voice/feature.JPG" alt="">
                <p>Even a lot more variation of features and optimisation is needed for this program which involves the Hardware and OS environment change.</p>
